          On a turn, a player rolls the die 🎲 repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as
          possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on the die 🎲. However, if a player rolls a 1, the
          player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a
          1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that
          particular roll. A player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die 🎲) if they do not want to
          take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to
          hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. When a player reaches
          a total of 100 points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
